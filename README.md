My passage of course by GeekBrains [Object Oriented Programming](https://geekbrains.ru/courses/70).
In this repository was created the console version of the classic game "Snake", using C # and object-oriented programming (OOP). Each branch in the repository corresponds to a certain lesson of creation, game development stage.

The game consists of:

1. Snake (created with the help of asterisks)
2. Dollar sign (food for snake)
3. Borders of the screen (cons)

When the snake touches the dollar sign, it increases by one asterisk.

If the snake touches the boundaries of the screen or with itself, the message about the end of the game appears.
